# ubuntu-humanity-wallpapers
A collection of old Ubuntu Wallpapers sourced from all versions that contained the Unity desktop. Most Ubuntu branding has been removed as I typically use Arch-based distributions, but some may have slipped through.

An XML slideshow of all of these is also available for the GNOME and MATE desktops.
